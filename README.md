## DOLY vs DIY DOLY 

*The difference between DIY Doly and the official Doly robot.

While they share the same body shape and electronics, there are some key differences in terms of features and capabilities.

The official [Doly](https://doly.ai/) robot comes with many advanced features on the software side, such as Edge AI, Block-based programming, self-charging, speech recognition and many more. These features make it a powerful and versatile robot that can be customized to suit a variety of applications and use cases.

On the other hand, the DIY Doly project is designed to be a template for creating a customized robot. While it shares the same body and similar electronics as the official [Doly](https://doly.ai/) robot, it does not come with pre-loaded software. This means that you will need to program the robot yourself, using whatever software or programming language you prefer. 

It's worth noting that DIY Doly is an open-source project, which means that anyone can contribute to the development of the project and create their own customized version of the robot.

Luckily, both DIY Doly and the official Doly robot share the Raspberry Pi CM4. This makes it easy to find resources for programming and customization, as there are many existing tutorials and projects available online.

So, if you're looking for a fully-featured robot with advanced capabilities, the official [Doly](https://doly.ai/) robot may be the better choice for you. However, if you're looking more customizable and DIY-friendly robot platform, the DIY Doly project is a great option.
